This is the analysis code I wrote for the second major study of my PhD.

This work investigates if:
1. Healthy adults use the same muscle and kinematic synergies to control the movements of their dominant and non-dominant arms.
2. The same muscle and kinematic synergies are shared between all healthy adults. 
The data that was used for this analysis is not included here.
